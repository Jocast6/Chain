# Chain
The Git repository contains code for a Python class called Chain that implements functional programming operations such as mapping, filtering, and reducing on iterable objects. The class provides methods for chaining these operations together, allowing for the creation of complex pipelines that can be applied to data. The repository includes unit tests that demonstrate the functionality of the Chain class, including tests for mapping, filtering, zipping, enumerating, and sorting operations. The tests use a variety of input types, including lists and data classes, and compare the results to expected output. Overall, the repository provides a useful tool for developers who wish to implement functional programming concepts in their Python code.
